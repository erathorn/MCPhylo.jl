    "Such data is used for phylogenetic inference using Bayesian methods. Based on an Markov Process wich describes the untderlying evolutionary process of character evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods can be used to estimate a posterior of phylogenetic trees. Using such (or other) trees, further statistical questions can be asked. Several of these questions are based on a statistical model whose parameters need to be infered using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. This requires a flexible framework which can be used to define these models. Additionally, inference should be relatively fast.\n",
